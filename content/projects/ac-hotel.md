Born of its Spanish roots and European soul,Â The AC Gangnam Hotel, is design with the approach of function over form, focusing on functionality and disconnecting it from a trend of popular indicator of time, achieving the timeless aesthetics of European classic design overtime, which is unpretentious, elegant, inviting, seasoned, pure, sophisticated, sleek and stylish.

Materials used are preferred in wood, leather, and metal because they seemed durable and to age more gracefully overtime, achieving the timeless look and feel.

Furniture take on simple yet classic lines and shapes, neutral or natural colours, adding on simplistic visual appearances to the spaces without standing out from it.
