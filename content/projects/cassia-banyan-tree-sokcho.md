Situated on the East sea of Korea, Cassia Sokcho is inspired by port with a story. Originally a fishing village created by the north to seek refuge and sought livelihood by fishing and repairing nets in the past, it evolved as the major port and a major tourist hub in modern days. . 

Inspired from there, we embark a new journey with Cassia Sokcho, creating new memories and stories onboard by a fisherman's eyes. A whole journey from early morning to late afternoon, we reflected the overall appreciation of nature's reflection at play, engages guest interaction during the stay.
