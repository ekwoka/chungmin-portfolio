We take inspiration from Daejeon train station which serves as a hub of transportation and is at the crossroads of major transport routes, such as train station structure, railways, shopfronts, and textures.

It showcases the past and the present, drawing people of diverse cultures together.

The team distilled elements from the surrounding neighborhood vernacular of Daejeon train station. Incorporated throughout the hotel is blue metalwork, column corner details, printed floor pattern, concrete and painted timber with neon lighting, colored subway tile, and fun scrabble wall tiles.
