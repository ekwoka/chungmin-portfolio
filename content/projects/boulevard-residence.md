All the worldâ€™s a stage and all the men and women merely players.

William Shakespeare



Located on the top floor of the condominium in Orchard, Boulevard residence is inspired by a theatrical stage where a diva stands on. 

After arriving from a private elevator, client first enters a foyer which will greet her with soft curved lines and elegant surroundings. Elevate the space with burgundy marble inserts floor and bronze metal wall trim. Bring the soft curved lines on the wall and place a full height mirror with modern classic molding, which ease the stress from hustle and bustle and lift up the mood for great start of a day.
